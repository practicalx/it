5] Explain setInterval function and setTimeout function with the help of an example

setInterval() is a javascript method used to schedule the execution of a function at a specific interval until the interval
id generated by the setInterval() is cleared. Code Segment:
let timerId = setInterval(function() {
alert('This alert will appear every 2 seconds');
}, 2000);
This will generate a alert every two second until the timerId is cleared. setTimeout() is a javascript method used to schedule the execution of a function after a specific amount of time but will
only run single time. Code Segment:
setTimeout(function() {
alert('This alert will appear after 5 seconds');
}, 5000);
This will generate a alert only a single time but after 5 seconds of delay
